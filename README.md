## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a project that explores the clustering of GPA (Grade Point Average) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient) scores to gain insights into academic and cognitive patterns among students.

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Clustering GPA and IQ: Academic and Cognitive Insights" project, which leverages clustering techniques to analyze a dataset containing GPA (Grade Point Average) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient) scores. The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and can be found here. Clustering is a powerful unsupervised machine learning approach that allows us to group similar data points together, uncovering underlying patterns and structures within the data.

### Project Goals:

The primary goal of this project is to cluster students based on their GPA and IQ scores to gain a deeper understanding of academic and cognitive trends. By doing so, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

> Identify Student Profiles: Discover distinct groups of students with similar academic and cognitive profiles. These clusters may reveal common characteristics or trends among students.

> Analyze Academic Performance: Determine whether there are clusters of students with significantly different academic performances, shedding light on variations in GPA.

> Explore Cognitive Patterns: Investigate whether clusters exhibit variations in IQ scores, offering insights into cognitive diversity among students.

## Dataset:

Our analysis relies on a comprehensive dataset containing GPA and IQ scores, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset has been preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency.

## Why Clustering?

Clustering provides a valuable perspective for understanding complex datasets. In this context, it allows us to categorize students into groups with similar academic and cognitive characteristics, enabling educators, policymakers, and institutions to tailor their approaches to better meet the needs of specific student clusters.
